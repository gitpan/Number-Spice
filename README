Number::Spice groups functions for converting plain decimal numbers to/from
the shortened Spice syntax, i.e. a decimal number followed by a literal suffix
representing some unit.

Number::Spice was written to support the number format used in the syntax
for netlists for the spice electrical circuit simulator. This number
format is also used in other applications, even in different fields.
Number::Spice can be used to any purpose, and does not require the
installation of the spice simulator.

Spice syntax provides a shortcut for writing down numbers in scientific 
notation, by appending a suffix to the value which corresponds to a
numeric multiplier. The following table lists the minimal suffices and
the corresponding multiplier:

	T	1.0E12
	G	1.0E9
	MEG	1.0E6
	X	1.0E6
	K	1.0E3
	M	1.0E-3
	MIL	2.54E-5 (i.e. 1/1000 inch)
	U	1.0E-6
	N	1.0E-9
	P	1.0E-12	
	F	1.0E-15
	A	1.0E-18
